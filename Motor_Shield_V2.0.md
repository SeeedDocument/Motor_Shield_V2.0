!!!Note
    This document works for Motor Shield V2.0/2.1/2.2.


The Motor Shield is a driver module for motors that allows you to use Arduino to control the working speed and direction of the motor. Based on the Dual Full-Bridge Drive Chip L298, it is able to drive two DC motors or a step motor. The Motor Shield can either be powered directly by Arduino or by an external 6V~15V power supply via the terminal input. This module can be used for the development of micro robots and intelligent vehicles, etc

## Getteing Started

Here we will show you how to drive a dc motor and a stepper with this shield.

We need a[ Seeeduino V4 ](http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/LinkIt_Smart_7688#Getting_Started)as the controller, Seeeduino V4 is an Arduino compatible board, and you can use an Arduino as well.

And you need a dc motor or a stepper for testing.

### Download the library

Click the below button to download the library. If the library you had download include "**-master**", please remove it.

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeeedDocument/Motor_Shield_V2.0/master/image/400px-Motor_shield_v2_library.png)](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/SeeedMotorShieldV2)

### Drive a DC Motor
You can drive 2 DC motor with this shield. Here I will show you how to drive a DC motor.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeeedDocument/Motor_Shield_V2.0/master/image/400px-Electric_motor_cycle_2.png)

You need to do some preparing first:

- Set **SEN_A** and **SEN_B**, connect the left 2 pins together with a jumper.
- Connect **MB_EN** together with a jumper, as we are no going use an external power.
- Connect your DC motor to Chanel 0 (OUT1 and OUT2).

Then open **motor_dc** example in the library. Upload the code to Seeeduino V4.2.

```Javascript
//  Demo function:The application method to drive the DC motor.
//  Author:Loovee (luweicong@seeed.cc)
//  2016-3-11
 
#include "MotorDriver.h"

MotorDriver motor;
 
void setup()
{
    // initialize
    motor.begin();
}
 
void loop()
{
    motor.speed(0, 100);            // set motor0 to speed 100
    delay(1000);
    motor.brake(0);                 // brake
    delay(1000);
    motor.speed(0, -100);           // set motor0 to speed -100
    delay(1000);
    motor.stop(0);                  // stop
    delay(1000);
}
// END FILE
```
Then you will find your motor move (1s), stop (1s), move back (1s), stop (1s), and loop.

If there's nothing happen, please make sure:

- You had uploaded the code successfully
- Your motor connect right
- The led indicators blink right

### Drive a Stepper
You can drive a 4-wire stepper with this shield. Here I will show you how to drive a [ stepper ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepper_motor)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeeedDocument/Motor_Shield_V2.0/master/image/400px-StepperMotor.gif)

You need to do some preparing first:
- Set **SEN_A** and **SEN_B**, connect the left 2 pins together with a jumper.
- Connect **MB_EN** together with a jumper, as we are no going to use an external power.

Find the pin definitions of you stepper, and connect it to the OUTPUT of the shield. As below:

|Stepper   |Motor Shield  |
|:------|:-----------------|
|A+   |	OUT1  |
|A-	|OUT2  |
|B+ 	|OUT3  |
|B-    |OUT4 |

Then open **stepper_test** example in the library, upload it to Seeeduino V4, then you will find your stepper move.
```
/*
 * Stepper test for Seeed Motor Shield V2
 * loovee @ 15 Mar, 2016
 */
 
#include <Stepper.h>
 
// change this to the number of steps on your motor
#define STEPS 200
 
// create an instance of the stepper class, specifying
// the number of steps of the motor and the pins it's
// attached to
Stepper stepper(STEPS, 8, 11, 12, 13);
 
// the previous reading from the analog input
int previous = 0;
 
void step(int steps)
{
    digitalWrite(9, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(10, HIGH);
    stepper.step(steps);
    digitalWrite(9, LOW);
    digitalWrite(10, LOW);
}
 
void setup()
{
    // set the speed of the motor to 30 RPMs
    pinMode(9, OUTPUT);
    pinMode(10, OUTPUT);
    digitalWrite(9, LOW);
    digitalWrite(10, LOW);
    stepper.setSpeed(30);
}
 
void loop()
{
    step(1000);
    step(-1000);
}
 
// END FILE
```
If there's nothing happen, please double check if you had connected the wire right.

## Library APIs

### begin
**Description**
```Javascript
void begin();
```
### speed
**Description**

Set speed, control by PWM.
```Javascript
void move(int motor_id, int speed);
```
- motor_id
  - 0 - Chanel 0
  - 1 - Chanel 1
- speed: -100~100, the larger the faster, 0 for stop

**stop**
```Javascript
void stop(unsigned char motor_id);
```
**brake**
```Javascript
void brake(unsigned char motor_id);
```
### Stepper
**Note** that we use the library provided by Arduino IDE to drive a stepper.

There's something need to be modified, please refer the examples.
